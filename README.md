# iLearnNN

This repository is part of my machine learning learning journey inspired by the Coursera Machine Learning Specialization. It contains projects related to decision trees, machine learning advice, and neural network implementations for binary and multiclass classification tasks.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. Decision-Trees

- **Project:** [Decision_Tree.ipynb](Decision-Trees/Decision_Tree.ipynb)
- **Description:** Implementation of a decision tree from scratch and application to the task of classifying whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

### 2. ML-Advice

- **Project:** [ML_Advice.ipynb](ML-Advice/ML_Advice.ipynb)
- **Description:** Exploration of techniques to evaluate and improve machine learning models.

### 3. NeuralNet-HDR-Binary

- **Project:** [NN_HDR_Binary.ipynb](NeuralNet-HDR-Binary/NN_HDR_Binary.ipynb)
- **Description:** Using a neural network to recognize hand-written digits zero and one.

### 4. NeuralNet-HDR-Multiclass

- **Project:** [NN_HDR_Multiclass.ipynb](NeuralNet-HDR-Multiclass/NN_HDR_Multiclass.ipynb)
- **Description:** Using a neural network to recognize hand-written digits 0-9.

## Coursera Machine Learning Specialization

This repository draws inspiration from the [Coursera Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) as part of my ongoing machine learning journey.

Feel free to explore the projects and learnings shared in each directory!
